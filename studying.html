  <p> This is where I'll add what I know about studying, plus my own thoughts! </p>
  
  <p> Since this website is mostly for me, I'll be attaching links to my own notes that will be private Google Docs. (I don't really expect anyone to stumble upon my website! 
  I am taking 5 AP's in school this year, and self-studying for AP Computer Science A. I find that it is very finally for me to make these summary sheets in Google Docs deriving all that I need to know from school material, CollegeBoard Daily videos, online resources, and Princeton Reviews. </p>
  <ol>
    <li> AP Statistics (mostly done) </li>

    <li> AP Environmental Science </li>
    <li> AP Physics 2 </li>

    <li> AP Spanish </li>
    <li> AP CSA </li>

  <p> I am also studying for my driver's permit... ughhh. </p>

  <h2> Studying tools I recommend:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> 
      <a href = "https://track.toggl.com/timer"> Toggl Time tracker </a> You can enter what you are currently working on, such as "web dev" and it will track the time you spent on it. This makes me feel very rewarded at the end of the day or week as I see that I used my time efficiently. I also usually work for 1 hour on a specific task, take a 10-minute break, and choose what to work on next.
