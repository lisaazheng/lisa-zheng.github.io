  <h1> Hosting a Hackathon!</h1>
  <p>I just finished judging submissions for a hackathon that I hosted. I found that in 2025, people really really like using AI. There are a lot of topics that are overused, such as study/productivity tools and medical assistants. I found that the most well-done typically had a very modern user interface, presented it in a humorous or understandable way, and the project idea was something never done before.
Sadly, based on the pitch of voice in the video submissions alone, there were only 2 girls out of the 39 submissions. The gender inequality definitely is present. 
  Using Devpost to host the Hackathon was a good idea, since it attracted people from all over the world. We got people from Egypt, Germany, Singapore, Canada, Norway, and India!</p>
